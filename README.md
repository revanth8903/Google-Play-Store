INTRODUCTION: This dataset holds app data from 2010 until 2018. Each app (row) has values for catergory, rating, size, and more, this information is scraped from the Google Play Store. This app information would not be available without it.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: we are aiming to understand the trend of current Google Playstore market, Because as a developer, I should know the best constraints to focus on when launching my first app :D . And I definitely have no intention of getting lost in this vast ocean of versatile apps XD
